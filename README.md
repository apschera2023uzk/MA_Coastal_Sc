## Project Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and scripts from my Master‚Äôs thesis in meteorology. The thesis investigates the representation of stratocumulus clouds in two large-eddy simulation (LES) models ‚Äì ICON-LES and UCLA-LES ‚Äì using observational data from Iquique, Chile.

Stratocumulus clouds significantly impact Earth‚Äôs radiation budget. However, weather and climate models still struggle to simulate their structure and variability accurately. This project evaluates how well the ICON and UCLA models reproduce cloud properties such as cloud top height, liquid water path, and boundary layer depth.

Sensitivity studies on various model parameters (e.g. sea surface temperature, vertical resolution, turbulence parameters) are conducted to understand discrepancies between model outputs and microwave radiometer / Cloudnet observations.

## Notes

- This repo reflects an academic research project and includes exploratory scripts.
- Some notebooks are experimental and not fully cleaned. The work is best understood when read together with the thesis PDF (not included here).
- Model data not provided here due to size limitations.
